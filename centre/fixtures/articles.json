      "body_english": "<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"vwtb\"><tbody><tr><td id=\"article_content\">Chinese Communist Party leaders typically do all they can to ensure their names earn a permanent spot in the history books, scratching and biting so their signature ideas   Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, Jiang Zemin's Three Represents, and the latest, Hu Jintao's Scientific Development   are inscribed indelibly in the country's seminal documents.<br><br>But not Premier Wen Jiabao. He prefers everyone just pretend he never existed.<br><br>In a recent speech to members of the Chinese community in Thailand, footage of which was posted to the website thaicn.com on Wednesday, Mr. Wen gave what sounded like farewell speech, despite having another four months at the helm of the world's second-largest economy.<br><br>What was remarkable about the speech was not so much its content as the way it ended.<br><br>'In the pursuit of truth, I would die nine times without regret. If I'm going to die, I want to die with honesty and integrity,' he said as he was wrapping up, a paraphrase of his favorite poet, Qu Yuan. To that he added: 'I hope everyone will forget me   that includes Chinese people and overseas Chinese. Forget me.'<br><br>Huh?<br><br>While it's not unreasonable for a leader approaching the end of 10 years in office to get emotional, this was an odd thing to statement even for a man far less reserved than China's stoic No. 2. So what was he trying to say?<br><br>Certainly Mr. Wen has reason to crave anonymity. After all, for the past several months, he's had to watch as the economic machine he once piloted to record growth has sputtered and slowed, stoking speculation that the China miracle might not be all it's cracked up to be. And then there was the recent foreign media report on his relatives' considerable holdings   the sort of bombshell that would make any politician, not to mention one who cultivated an image as a reformer, want to slip from the stage and be forgotten.<br><br>But it should also be noted that Mr. Wen has a flair for dramatic acts of rhetorical humility -  a tendency that fed into now-exiled writer Yu Jie's characterization of the premier as China's 'greatest actor.' So in that sense, maybe he was trying to employ a little reverse psychology: Remember me because I didn't want to be remembered.<br><br>In any case, at least one prominent Chinese citizen, real estate mogul Ren Zhiqiang, insisted that Mr. Wen would not be forgotten. 'Some things can never be erased,' he wrote Thursday night in a post on Sina Corp.'s Weibo microblogging service.<br><br>It wasn't clear if Mr. Ren was responding to the skyrocketing property prices that happened under Mr. Wen's watch, the premier's subsequent effort to push prices back down, or something else.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>",
